        Concept bottleneck models (CBMs) are interpretable neural networks that
        first predict labels for human-interpretable concepts relevant to the
        prediction task, and then predict the final label based on the concept
        label predictions. We extend CBMs to interactive prediction settings
        where the model can query a human collaborator for the label to some
        concepts. We develop an interaction policy that, at prediction time,
        chooses which concepts to request a label for so as to maximally improve
        the final prediction. We demonstrate that a simple policy combining concept
        prediction uncertainty and influence of the concept on the final prediction
        achieves strong performance and outperforms static approaches as well as
        active feature acquisition methods proposed in the literature. We show that
        the interactive CBM can achieve accuracy gains of 5-10% with only 5 
        interactions over competitive baselines on the Caltech-UCSD Birds, CheXpert
         and OAI datasets.
